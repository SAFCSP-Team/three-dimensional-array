# Three-Dimensional Array

### Objective
The project's main focus is understanding three-dimensional arrays, declaring them, and accessing their elements using indexes.

### Problem
Create a 3D array called `elements` with 2x2x2 dimensions of type `char`.

### Implementation
- Create an array of `elements` with 2x2x2 dimensions.
- Initialize the array with its default values.
- Print the array.
- Update an element of the array.
- Print the array again.

``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }

}
```
